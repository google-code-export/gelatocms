We will use the gelato developes as mentors.

We have asked core gelato committers whether they are interested to mentor students in an open call to the developers mailing list.

Our aim is to use them because they have the best development practices on the project and have been through the gelato process already and know the way around the project.

== Who will your mentors be? Please enter their Google Account address separated by commas. If your organization is accepted we will email each mentor to invite them to take part. (optional) ==
